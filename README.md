# OpenAGC

OpenProspero's GPL-3.0-or-later C99 path to a **working PS5 GPU and
display driver**, with Vulkan 1.0 and OpenGL running natively on one
shared OpenAGC backend.

## Goal

Become a real PS5 GPU/display driver: qualified firmware submit,
executable pipelines, draws, and presentation — with host-testable
VK/GL frontends on the same core. Current gaps (compiler gate, missing
CB/DRAW evidence, presentation) are tracked stages, not the product
identity.

## Current status (honest)

| Area | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Memory, buffers, copy queues, fences | Host simulation with explicit errors |
| Images / clears | Host-linear RGBA8/BGRA8; CPU clear fills; WRITE_DATA tiling ≤32×8 |
| Compute (narrow) | Console-proven `store_const` and `store_span` (1–8 lanes) via host CPU path |
| Shader intake | Unverified fixtures **and** pin-checked `OPENGNM_PSBC` envelopes (`psbc_envelope=1`) |
| Pipelines | Structural plans; shared host PSBC and AGC linker-register snapshots (no DRAW) |
| Color-buffer bind words | Host-composed nine-register linear RGBA8 bind (Step AB), console round-trip proven for encode/record only |
| Vulkan / OpenGL | Shared frontend core; equivalent work lands on the same backend bytes |
| GPU rasterizer | `openagc_raster_encode_draw` (shared, host-locked): composes the AGC-shaped draw IB — scalar state, context/uconfig tables, ES/PS program, color bind, one draw |
| Attribute-less draws | Bind + draw recorded; still `NOT_READY` (no CB/DRAW / no `gpu_executable`) |
| First console DRAW | **Proven (Step AQ)**: the AGC-submitted raster draw writes exactly the pinned pixel shader's colour into the caller's target - 64 pixels, the viewport rectangle, empty guard. Earlier steps: the AGC-shaped IB retires on FW9.40 but writes no pixel (Steps AE-AH: either colour bind, either draw initiator). With viewport transform on, the NGG draw stops retiring (Steps AJ-AM). Step AN corrected the `VGT_ESGS_RING_ITEMSIZE` register address, wrote and read its captured value 1, and used `CB_NORMAL`; it still timed out with zero pixels. A later source audit found that Steps AF and AN left the optional fragment-gate mask unset; the corrected payload has only offline validation. The legacy draw retires without a pixel while its topology readback stays zero. |
| Draws / general dispatch | Refused (`NOT_READY` from compiler gate) |
| Presentation / swapchain | Native GPU swapchain refused; experimental CPU VideoOut presenter added for QuickJS |
| `compiler_verified` / `gpu_executable` | Always **0** on accepted plans today |

## PS5 policy (qualification gate, not blanket deny)

| Area | `OpenAGC::ps5_policy` |
| --- | --- |
| Same public symbols | Every public symbol is defined; host entry points stay fail-closed |
| Qualification record | `openagc_ps5_policy_qualification` / `openagc_ps5_policy_require` state what the one observed firmware (`0x9400008`) qualified: copy+EOP, WRITE_DATA fills, compute stores, register programs, CB readback, IB dumps, the NGG program |
| Draws | `OPENAGC_PS5_CAP_DRAW` qualified for `0x9400008`: the AGC-submitted raster draw writes the pinned shader's colour (the shared EOP marker is not delivered on that path, so completion reads the target) |
| Full host GPU library | Must **not** be linked into a PS5 image; the command recorder is built separately for the VideoOut presenter |

An unknown firmware identity is not qualified: the table answers
`UNSUPPORTED_FIRMWARE`, and a capability without console evidence answers
`UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION`. Firmware fields in descriptors are diagnostic
hints, not authorization. The SDK QuickJS host uses
`openagc_ps5_videoout.c` to draw the recorder's frames on the CPU and submit
them to native VideoOut. This path has offline tests but awaits console display
confirmation. GPU draw execution remains explicitly gated.

## Stage gates (short)

See [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) for the full staged plan.

1. **Stages 1–4 (host)** — shared frontend core, VK/GL subsets, refuse unsupported ops. Done on host.
2. **Stage 5** — still gated:
   - **Compiler / executable shaders**: pin-checked PSBC envelopes may be
     intaken as structural (`psbc_envelope=1`); host register programs
     include context, shader, and vertex linkage pairs; `require_compiler`
     still returns `NOT_READY`; nothing sets `gpu_executable`.
   - **Draw / CB/DB PM4**: a nine-register linear color bind and NGG draw
     complete on FW9.40, but no fragment writes a pixel. Linker output,
     target defaults, and the native packet path still need comparison.
3. **Stages 6–7** — native tiling / coherency and presentation: refused
   until separate evidence.

## Console evidence (FW9.40, host-aligned only)

Separate SDK payloads on console proved, among other steps:

- DMA + EOP copy (`pm4_fw940.h`, 31 dwords)
- WRITE_DATA fills through MAX_ROWS / MAX_COLS grid (Steps D–H, M, N)
- Compute `store_const` and `store_span` chains through SPAN_MAX (I–L)

The host library encodes aligned PM4 snapshots and simulates on CPU; it
**never** submits those words to a console from this tree until a
reviewed, evidence-backed path exists. Draw/render packets remain
unavailable.

## Build

```text
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Debug
ctest --test-dir build --build-config Debug --output-on-failure
```

Headers (include as `<openagc/….h>`):

| Header | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `openagc.h` | Core ABI |
| `driver.h` | GPU device / copy / fence |
| `graphics.h` | Images and host clear path |
| `shader.h` | Artifact intake and pipeline plans |
| `frontend.h` | Shared VK/GL translation core |
| `raster.h` | GPU rasterizer: AGC-shaped draw composition and encoding |
| `ps5_policy.h` | PS5 qualification record for the observed firmware |
| `vulkan.h` / `opengl.h` | Host frontend subsets |
| `psbc_metadata.h` / `pm4_*_fw940.h` | PSBC reflection and PM4 helpers |

The [Electron/DOM port track](https://github.com/OpenProspero/sdk/blob/main/docs/ELECTRON.md)
pins a matching FreeBSD Electron 36.3.1 source and patch set, cross-compiles
an ABI probe through the canonical SDK, and runs a host offscreen DOM/paint
smoke app. Electron is not yet cross-compiled or running on PS5.

Link `OpenAGC::openagc` on the host via `add_subdirectory`. For PS5
policy-only builds, use `-DOPENAGC_PS5_POLICY_ONLY=ON` and link only
`OpenAGC::ps5_policy`. Recipe notes: [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Shader / PSBC (host)

- Fixtures: `OPENAGC_SHADER_COMPILER_UNVERIFIED_FIXTURE` (structural only).
- Pin-checked envelopes: `OPENAGC_SHADER_COMPILER_OPENGNM_PSBC` with
  matching `OPENAGC_SHADER_PINNED_PSBC_*` digest, revision, and metadata
  v14. Empty `descriptor_bindings` require zero OpenAGC
  bindings/textures; typed bindings must match the declared uniform
  buffers and combined image samplers exactly, and storage bindings or
  arrays stay `UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION`.
- Accepted PSBC artifacts report `psbc_envelope=1`, still
  `compiler_verified=0` and `gpu_executable=0`.
- Intake retains envelope metadata; graphics create auto-attaches the
  host SET_CONTEXT/SET_SH snapshot (plus vertex linkage context pairs)
  when both stages are envelopes. Explicit
  `openagc_frontend_pipeline_set_psbc_register_snapshot`
  (VK/GL wrappers) remains available. Host can patch
  `SPI_SHADER_PGM_LO/HI` from 256-byte-aligned code VAs and record the
  register program + EOP into the write snapshot (still
  `gpu_submitted=0`). After `bind_psbc_code`, VK queue submit / GL
  `bind_program` record the Step-U-shaped IB (69 + EOP = 93 dwords).
  No DRAW packets.
- Attribute-less plans (`vertex_input_mask == 0`) draw without a VBO;
  both frontends still stop at `NOT_READY`.
- After `bind_psbc_code`, both host frontends can intake the 34 context
  and three uconfig records emitted by AGC's linker through the shared
  `set_agc_linked_registers` path. These records are retained in host
  snapshots only; no linker capture or native draw is qualified.
- Both host frontends can prepend the public 16-record AGC COLOR0 target
  shape through `set_agc_target_registers` after linking. The shared core
  validates the register order and a nonzero caller-owned target base.
  The snapshot remains host-only; PS5 policy refuses the call.
- `openagc_frontend_agc_build_linear_target` derives those records for an
  aligned RGBA8/BGRA8 linear image from caller-supplied AGC defaults. It
  validates the 256-byte row pitch and address span once for both frontends.
- Build-time compiler job: [`.github/workflows/build-psbc-host.yml`](.github/workflows/build-psbc-host.yml)
  (manual-only). Details: [docs/shader-toolchain.md](docs/shader-toolchain.md).

## Frontends (host)

Vulkan and OpenGL share `frontend.h`: one staging/copy/transition path,
native→backend translation, and explicit refuse for unsupported formats
and layouts. Equivalence: `tests/test_openagc_equivalence.c` (including
WRITE_DATA grid clears, depth clears, and PSBC register snapshots).

Narrow compute exception on host only: `host_store_const` /
`host_store_span` with groups `1,1,1` (console-proven blobs), without
opening a compute queue or flipping `gpu_executable`.

Public PS5_Vulkan / ps5-opengl and Mesa work is used for register and
runtime contracts. The next native stage will reuse compatible public
components where that speeds homebrew integration, with provenance and
licenses retained. No third-party source, SDK, firmware, or proprietary
blob is currently vendored or linked.
